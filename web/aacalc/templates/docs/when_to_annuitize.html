<h1>When to Anuitize</h1>

<p>
This note is very graph heavy, so before your eyes glaze over looking
at many figures that all look just about the same, I want to skip to
the conclusion and focus on the one figure that really matters.
</p>

<div class="center">
<img src="/static/docs/when_to_annuitize/gradual_annuity-ssa-4-1.0.png" alt="default">
</div>

<p>
What this shows is the recommended allocation between stocks,
liability matching bonds, and inflation-indexed SPIAs for an
individual that currently holds no SPIAs. Suspend for a moment the
fact annuities can't reasonably be bought in small annual amounts. I
will suppose they can so that the optimal strategy can be discerned.
Later I will consider breaking the annuitization process up into a
small number of discrete chunks. Also don't get too hung up by my use
of liability matching bonds. A regular nominal non-long term bond fund
would do fine. It is just that in the present economic environment
liability matching bonds appear to have a small edge.
</p>

<p>
The above plot, and all the plots I will show are for an individual
that receives or will be receiving no Social Security or other defined
benefits. This is very important. Receiving Social Security is very
similar to receiving income from an inflation-indexed SPIA, and the
value of Social Security needs to be factored in as part of the
overall allocations of an individual.
</p>

<p>
Stocks are constant until you reach age 68, and decline to close to
zero at age 89.  The early constancy of stocks is consistent with the
findings of Merton that the optimal asset allocation is a static asset
allocation. The small allocation after age 90 is an artifact of the
model in which first any SPIAs are purchased, the first payout is
received, consumption occurs, and finally the remaining wealth is
allocated between stocks and bonds. The tail is the amount of the
first payout less consumption getting carried over into the next time
period unable to be annuitized in the model.
</p>

<p>
Liability matching bonds, that is inflation-indexed zero coupon bonds
with a duration based on your retirement life expectancy, start out at
18% at age 20, decline fairly steadily, and are fully annuitized by
age 68.  The possibility of performing early annuitization of the bond
portion of a portfolio isn't well known. Liability matching bonds and
inflation-indexed immediate annuities are priced using the same real
yield curve. So putting aside the issue of contract duration pricing
effects, one might wonder why any liability matching bonds at all, why
not just stocks and SPIAs?  Indeed a plot of just liability matching
bonds and just SPIAs is 100% SPIAs. I suspect the answer to why adding
stocks to the mix increases the holdings of liability matching bonds,
is bonds enable the portfolio to rebalance, which is not possible with
SPIAs.
</p>

<p>
Inflation-indexed immediate annuities start of at 32% at age 20,
increasing to close to 100% by age 90. When liability matching bonds
go to zero, the annuitization of stocks starts to take off, meaning
that the annuitization curve is smooth at age 68. An explanation of
this smoothness is that from the perspective of the SPIAs a higher and
higher rate of return is required from the rest of the portfolio to be
competitive with SPIAs. This is achieved by decreasing the bond
fraction, until it reaches zero, at which point the stock fraction
starts to reduce.
</p>

<p>
In earlier work (see Figure 6
of <a href="http://ssrn.com/abstract=2531779">Floor and Upside
Investing in Retirement with Nominal SPIAs</a>) I found bonds should
be 50% annuitized by age 45, and fully annuitized at 60, and stocks
50% annuitized by age 70, and fully annuitized by age 80. This study
also suggests early annuitization of the bond portfolio, and later
annuitization of the stock portfolio. What makes the present study,
and the results here slightly different, is the focus on liability
matching bonds, rather than nominal bonds returning 3.1% +/- 9.7%
which isn't realistic in the present interest rate environment, and if
it is ever realistic the price of annuities will also change; the use
of constant Money's Worth Ratios (MWRs) in the present study, whereas
the previous study attempted to more closely represent the observed
increased MWRs at advanced ages, making annuitization there more
attractive; and the use of inflation-indexed SPIAs rather than the
nominal SPIAs in the study cited.
</p>

<h2>Details</h2>

<p>
The results were computed using stochastic dynamic programming. All
calculations were performed in, and results are given in, real terms.
</p>

<ul>

<li> Sex: male. </li>

<li> Marital status: single. </li>

<li> Hypothetically born: 2016. </li>

<li> Lifespan: based on the U.S. Social Security Administration
Actuarial Study No. 120 cohort tables. </li>

<li> Retirement age: for pedagogical purposes results are shown for a
retirement age pushed all the way back to age 0; this does not affect
the generality of the results for a retiree; for a pre-retiree it only
makes a small difference as will be explored later.

<li> Utility of consumption: constant relative risk aversion, with a
coefficient of relative risk aversion, &gamma;, of 4.; many economists
suggest a lower value of &gamma; such as 2 or 3, while others suggest
a value of 10 or higher.; the value chosen is intended to show the
results for an asset allocation that comprises a balance of stocks and
fixed income assets. </li>

<li> Income: $10/year of defined benefits was provided to avoid
negative infinities when computing utilities. </li>

<Li> Portfolio size: the results shown are for portfolios totaling
$100,000; the size chosen doesn't effect the results shown. </li>

<li> Consumption: consumption was chosen to maximize the utility of
consumption weighted by the probability of being alive. </li>

<li> Stock market returns: arithmetic 7.2%, volatility 17.0%; this
reflects world experience for 1900-2000. </li>

<Li> Liability matching bonds: a portfolio of zero coupon
inflation-indexed bonds with amounts and durations reflecting the
probability the individual is alive at future ages; as the individual
ages the duration of the liability matching bonds shrinks, and with
it, assuming a static normal yield curve, the liability matching bonds
average yield. </li>

<li> Liability matching bond returns: computed using the U.S. Treasury
real constant maturity Treasury yield curve on 2015-12-31 and
projected mortality; an interpolating spline is used for durations not
reported by the Treasury and durations beyond 30 years are computed
using the average forward rate 15 years and over, consistent with
Treasury methodology. </li>

<li> Inflation-indexed income annuity prices: based on the Treasury
real yield curve and the Society of Actuaries 2012 Individual Annuity
Mortality Basic table with mortality adjusted for contract length
using the 2005-08 Individual Payout Annuity Experience Report Table 3a
Immediate annuity, nonrefund, 2012IAM "G2 for 5", aggregated according
to annual income. </li>

<li> Static yield curve assumption: The same static duration varying
yield curve is assumed to exist throughout time. </li>

<li> Annuitization: For the model annuitization isn't something that
must be performed all at once, but is capable of being performed
gradually from one year to the next. </li>

<li> Money's Worth Ratio: 100%; a value of 100% is consistent with the
best observations in the market place. </li>

<li> Management expenses: 0%. </li>

<li> Taxes: none. </li>

<li> Bequest motive: none. </li>

<li> Time step: a discrete time step of 1 year was used. </li>

<li> Rebalancing: rebalancing is performed annually to the target
allocation, except of course for SPIA holdings which may be increased,
but can't decrease. </li>

</li>

<h2>Why liability matching bonds? Why now?</h2>

<p>
I will consider an average bond fund, made up of a mixture of
corporates, Treasuries, agency, and muni bonds. Taking into account
bond defaults, by my estimate, such a fund earns around 0.7% above the
10 year Treasury yield. As of 2005-12-31, constant maturity 10 year
Treasuries were projected to earn 2.3% nominal, which is 0.1% above
the Survey of Professional Forecasters 2015Q4 10 year inflation
projection. Add to this a premium of 0.7% for the typical bond fund,
gives a total expected real return for nominal bonds of around
0.8%. For 1927-2014, the volatility of 10 year constant maturity
Treasuries was 9.6%. However, for the buy and hold investor, this is
not the volatility we want. The long term buy and hold investor will
experience a much lower volatility, similar to the volatility in the
CPI, which was 4.1%. Historically the correlation of nominal bonds to
stocks has been around 7%.
</p>

<p>
Plugging the above values in results in the following plot for a
stocks, liability matching bonds, regular nominal bonds, and no
annuities portfolio.
</p>

<div class="center">
<img src="/static/docs/when_to_annuitize/gradual_annuity-ssa-4-bonds-no_annuity.png" alt="bonds, no SPIA">
</div>

<p>
Before getting to the meat of the above figure, first note the slight
upward increase in the allocation to stocks. This can be understood
with reference to Merton's formula as a side effect of the risk free
rate of return gradually declining as the duration of liability
matching bonds decreases.
</p>

<p>
The decline in liability matching bonds, and rise in nominal bonds at
around age 70 is a result of the liability matching bonds duration
shrinking to the point that the return of nominal bonds is better.
But this is misleading, since it is also the age at which the
volatility experienced exceeds that of the CPI, since there is no
certainty such bonds will be held and consumed long term.
</p>

<p>
Even if the above were not the case the complete annuitization of the
bond portion of a portfolio starting at age 68 makes the presence of
nominal bonds at advanced ages moot. This is shown in the following
figure in which I also add inflation-indexed SPIAs to the mix.
</p>

<div class="center">
<img src="/static/docs/when_to_annuitize/gradual_annuity-ssa-4-1.0-bonds.png" alt="bonds">
</div>

<p>
Repeating the same experiment for 2004-12-31 gives a different
result. The 10 year constant maturity returns 4.2%, less 2004Q4
inflation expectations of 2.5%, plus a premium of 0.7% for a typical
bond fund, giving 2.4% real. This compares to 2.0% real for a 30 year
zero coupon Treasury. Given this, it is no surprise that nominal bonds
dominate liability matching bonds as shown in the figure below.
</p>

<div class="center">
<img src="/static/docs/when_to_annuitize/gradual_annuity-ssa-4-1.0-2004-12-31-bonds.png" alt="2004-12-31 bonds">
</div>

<p>
Despite nominal bonds dominating liability matching bonds, the
difference between using and not using nominal bonds is not all that
great.They provided a 2.2% increase in lifetime certainty equivalent
income assuming the 2004-12-31 yield curve. Conversely, using nominal
bonds exclusively in place of liability matching bonds caused a 1.1%
reduction in lifetime certainty equivalent income when assuming the
2015-12-31 yield curve throughout.
</p>


<p>
It might be possible to obtain better returns today by switching
exclusively to corporate bonds. Quoted yields don't include the cost
of downgrades and defaults, so this would need to be factored in.  The
danger of this however is such bond funds are likely to underperform
when there is an economic downturn, which is precisely when they are
needed the most.
</p>

<p>
It is also possible to switch to nominal bonds with a longer duration,
say 25 years instead of 10.  This would boost expected real returns by
about 0.7% to 1.5% based on zero coupon bond yields. Such returns are
likely to be competitive with the returns of liability matching
bonds. However, the time final period where their volatility makes
them inappropriate means they would be inappropriate beyond about age
50.  What is worse, and is unable to be captured by my model is an
uptick in inflation could seriously erode the real value of such
bonds. Long duration inflation-indexed bonds don't have this risk,
which is why they are frequently used as liability matching bonds.
</p>

<p>
In the future the return of nominal bonds may be higher, but so may
the return of liability matching bonds. The preference for liability
matching bonds over nominal bonds depends on the precise difference
between 10 year nominal yields, the spread above the 10 year yield of
the typical bond fund, inflation expectations, and the real yield
curve for all the durations that matter. This is highly dependent on
the economic environment we are in. In the present economic
environment liability matching bonds have the upper hand.
</p>

<p>
The premium you need to earn on a nominal bond fund over the Treasury
10 year constant maturity note for there to be at least some
allocation to nominal bonds is shown in the figure below. Note that
the real yield curve for 2005-12-30 was flat. I contend that for the
average bond fund the historical premium over the 10 year constant
maturity Treasury for has been about 0.7%. I derived this figure
looking at the breakdown bonds of different types reported in the
Fed's Flow of Funds releases, the BofA option adjusted spreads, and
Moody's downgrade and default rates. Based on this estimate you can
see there would be no nominal bonds using the 2015-12-31 yield curve
when compared against liability matching bonds with durations longer
than 14 years, and none for durations longer than 31 years using the
2010-12-31 yield curve, but for the other dates nominal bonds are
likely to put in a strong showing. In any event, a 31 year real
duration presents no computational difficulties but may prove
difficult to obtain in practice. Unfortunately there isn't historical
real yield data available to explore the issue of which performs best,
bond funds or liability matching bonds outside of the time interval
explored. It is likely that they perform reasonably similarly.

<h2>Mortality</h2>

<p>
Earlier I alluded to contract length adjustments to mortality. The IAM
mortality table I am using lumps all annuitants of a given age
together, and doesn't distinguish between an annuitant who just
purchased a SPIA contract and presumably is in very good health, and
an annuitant who purchased a SPIA contract 20 years ago and whose
health is more uncertain. The contract length adjustment is intended
to adjust mortality for the length of time a SPIA contract has been
held. The recommended strategy generated without making this
correction is shown below.
</p>

<div class="center">
<img src="/static/docs/when_to_annuitize/gradual_annuity-ssa-4-1.0-aer_none.png" alt="AER none">
</div>

<p>
The difference is small, the portion of liability matching bonds
initially held has moved from 18 to 19%, and the age at which
liability matching bond holding reaches zero moves from 68 to 71.
</p>

<p>
The most detailed version if the Annuity Experience Report breaks
thing down by contract length and age. Their sample size however is
too small, introducing noise into the results for advanced ages. This
is true even after eliminating the most egregious outlier value from
the sample, as shown below. Because of this noise I stick to using the
age aggregated contract duration adjustment.
</p>

<div class="center">
<img src="/static/docs/when_to_annuitize/gradual_annuity-ssa-4-1.0-aer_full.png" alt="AER full">
</div>

<p>
I normally assume the average annuitant is only in average health as
given by the Social Security cohort tables, but that annuities are
priced using the contract length adjusted Society of Actuaries IAM
table, which I consider to denote someone in excellent health. The
life expectancy at birth of the hypothetical male is 81.4 using the
SSA cohort table, and 89.0 using the IAM table. The results from
assuming the individual was in excellent health at birth and using the
IAM table with a contract length equal to their age are shown below.
There is very little difference between this and the original plot
prior to age 90.
</p>

<div class="center">
<img src="/static/docs/when_to_annuitize/gradual_annuity-iam2012-4-1.0.png" alt="iam2012">
</div>

<p>
To be sure nothing has gone wrong, the figure below shows the strategy
for an artificial Gompertz(70, 10) mortality table. The life
expectancy at birth has dropped to 64.5. Note that annuitization is
declining. at age 20, the recommended annuitization is 28%, but if by
age 70, you haven't purchased any annuities, your life expectancy is
now so bleak relative to annuity prices the recommended annuitization
is only 15%.  In my Gompertz model the probability of death at age 94
is 100%, making the results at and beyond this point meaningless.
</p>

<div class="center">
<img src="/static/docs/when_to_annuitize/gradual_annuity-gompertz-4-1.0-gompertz_70_10.png" alt="Gompertz (70, 10)">
</div>

<h2>Sensitivity to &gamma;</h2>

<p>
It is important to explore the sensitivity of annuitization to changes
in different parameters. The first parameter I will explore is the
coefficient of relative risk aversion, &gamma;. A &gamma; of 2
represents a low degree of risk aversion as shown below. No liability
matching bonds are ever held, and stocks become fully annuitized at
around age 90.
</p>

<div class="center">
<img src="/static/docs/when_to_annuitize/gradual_annuity-ssa-2-1.0.png" alt="gamma=2">
</div>

<p>
A &gamma; of 3 starts to tell a familiar story as shown below. Note
that stock holdings are initially significantly higher than they are
in the default case of a &gamma; of 4. Despite this the holdings of
liability matching bonds are similar. Initially 15% instead of 18% at
age 20, and dropping to zero at age 63 instead of age 68.
</p>

<div class="center">
<img src="/static/docs/when_to_annuitize/gradual_annuity-ssa-3-1.0.png" alt="gamma=3">
</div>

<p>
Increasing &gamma; all the way up to 6, stocks fall, annuitization
rises, but liability matching bonds stay much the same, starting at
17% at age 20, and falling to zero at age 71 as shown below.
</p>

<div class="center">
<img src="/static/docs/when_to_annuitize/gradual_annuity-ssa-6-1.0.png" alt="gamma=6">
</div>

<p>
The reason for the lack of sensitivity of liability matching bond
holdings to changes in &gamma; is liability matching bonds are not
there as a risk offsetting holding, SPIAs perform that role, but as a
vehicle that offsets stocks and allows them to rebalance.
</p>

<p>
Liability matching bonds can be considered as a risk free
asset. Merton's formula does a good job of predicting the holdings of
stocks as shown in the following table. It should be noted that
Merton's formula assumes lognormally distributed returns whereas I use
returns shaped according to the observed historical returns
distribution.

<h2>Sensitivity to expected market returns</h2>

<p>
The following figure shows what happens when I increase the expected
arithmetic return on stocks from 7.2% to 9.4%, well within the bounds
of two standard errors of its observed value; and the upper bound of
an 80% confidence interval of its true value. As expected the holding
of stocks rises, but the holdings of liability matching bonds appears
virtually unchanged.
</p>

<div class="center">
<img src="/static/docs/when_to_annuitize/gradual_annuity-ssa-4-1.0-stocks_9.4_17.0.png" alt="stocks=9.4%+/-17.0%">
</div>

<p>
Next I consider switching from returns indicative of world stock
market experience, 7.2% +/- 17.0% volatility, to returns indicative of
the U.S. stock market from 1927-2014, 8.7% +/- 19.6%. This is shown
below. Note that despite the increased return, stock holdings have
decreased slightly on account of the offsetting increased
volatility. This is consistent with Merton's formula. More
significantly liability matching bonds holdings have increased. This
is the smoking gun that the role of liability matching bonds is a
buffer in the event that stocks do poorly and rebalancing is
necessary. Increase the volatility of stocks and the need for
liability matching bonds increases.
</p>

<div class="center">
<img src="/static/docs/when_to_annuitize/gradual_annuity-ssa-4-1.0-stocks_8.7_19.6.png" alt="stocks=8.7%+/-19.6%">
</div>

<h2>Money's Worth Ratio</h2>

<p>
So far I have been assuming a MWR of 100% against the Treasury real
yield curve. This was reasonable in 2015 for inflation indexed SPIAs
from the AIG provider American General in the absence of state
taxes. A value of 95% appeared more appropriate for a higher credit
rated provider such as Principal Financial Group in the absence of
state taxes.
</p>

<p>
The figure below shows the results for an MWR of 95%. Stocks are
largely unchanged, although they become almost fully annuitized at age
90 instead of age 89. More significantly liability matching bonds have
increased and SPIAs decreased. Holdings of liability matching bonds
have increased from 18% to 23% at age zero, and reach zero at age 72
instead of 68. This makes sense since SPIAs are less valuable. The
magnitude of the change is small, suggesting the annuitization
strategy shouldn't be driven by the precise MWR.
</p>

<div class="center">
<img src="/static/docs/when_to_annuitize/gradual_annuity-ssa-4-0.95.png" alt="MWR=95%">
</div>

<h2>Real yield curve</h2>

<p>
We are in uncommon monetary times, with low real yields. The 5 year
TIPS note yields 0.5% while the 30 year TIPS bond yields 1.3%.  Eleven
years ago on 2004-12-31, the 5 year note yielded 1.0%, and the 20 year
bond 2.0%, with data for a 30 year note not being available. Eleven
years ago is more indicative of typical times. I choose to use 11
years ago because for 10 years ago the real yield curve was flat. The
figure below shows the strategy to be employed assuming a static yield
curve matching that of 2004-12-31. Stock holdings are lower, and
became close to fully annuitized at age 87. Liability matching bond
holdings start at 24% at age 20, and fall to zero at age 66. This is
as expected; higher liability matching bond holdings than in the
present time. Again however, the magnitude of the change is small.
</p>

<div class="center">
<img src="/static/docs/when_to_annuitize/gradual_annuity-ssa-4-1.0-2004-12-31.png" alt="2004-12-31">
</div>

<h2>Sex</h2>

<p>
The figure below shows the results for a female instead of a male. The
results are very similar. Stocks become close to fully annuitized at
age 90.  Liability matching bond holdings start at 19% at age 20 and
fall to zero at age 68.
</p>

<div class="center">
<img src="/static/docs/when_to_annuitize/gradual_annuity-ssa-4-1.0-female.png" alt="female">
</div>

<h2>Retirement age</h2>

<p>
To keep things simple I have been considering a retirement age of
zero. Obviously this is far from realistic, but was done for
pedagogical purposes. The figure below shows the recommended strategy
for a retirement age of 50.
</p>

<div class="center">
<img src="/static/docs/when_to_annuitize/gradual_annuity-ssa-4-1.0-retirement_age50.png" alt="retirement age 50">
</div>

<p>
Broadly speaking the recommendations are similar to before, but there
are some differences. Post age 50 the recommendations are identical to
before. Prior to age 50 there are two counteracting forces:
</p>

<ul>

<li> The constant force - previously, post age 50, it was necessary to
have liquid assets that could provide for both consumption and
rebalancing. Prior to age 50 it is now only necessary to have liquid
assets that can provide for rebalancing. This means a greater portion
of the portfolio can be annuitized. </li>

<li> The long range force - there are no longer any financial
obligations prior to age 50. This means for young ages the duration of
liability matching bonds is longer, pushing up their interest
rate. This favors liability matching bonds over inflation-indexed
SPIAs, particularly at young ages. </li>

</ul>

<p>
The constant force explains why SPIA levels are higher prior to age 50
than they would be for a retirement age of zero. Equivalently it
explains the dip in liability matching bond levels at age 40.
</p>

<p>
The long range force is harder to discern in the above plot, but is
obvious in the plot below which shows the recommended strategy for a
retirement age of 70.
</p>

<div class="center">
<img src="/static/docs/when_to_annuitize/gradual_annuity-ssa-4-1.0-retirement_age70.png" alt="retirement age 70">
</div>

<p>
Once again the annuitization curve prior to age 70 has moved up.
Below age 24 something new is observed. There are almost no SPIAs
held. I presume this is the long range force in action. The effective
return of SPIAs simply isn't competitive with that on liability
matching bonds. It is a very sharp transition. This can be understood
as thinking of liability matching bonds and SPIAs as risk free
assets. Either one of them has a better rate of return, or the other,
and it is all one or all the other, except that when SPIAs are
favored, then there is still a need for liability matching bonds for
rebalancing purposes.
</p>

<h2>Optimal versus good enough</h2>

<p>
So far I have focused on trying to find the optimal strategy, which
shows the fixed income portion of a portfolio being annuitized very
early, but what if the optimal strategy is only marginally better than
some other simpler strategy. I will consider the effect of only
allowing SPIAs to be purchased on or after some age. For this I employ
the concept of a trust fund baby. An individual that starts out with
money at birth, invests it according to the recommended strategy, and
then draws on it in retirement. I consciously chose this approach
rather than the alternative approach of an individual that starts with
no assets and accumulates them over time according to a fixed
schedule, because expected future savings counts as a virtual fixed
income like asset that would offset other fixed income holdings. The
figure below provides an example of strategy for a trust fund baby
retiring at age 70 and only able to start purchasing annuities at age
70.

<p>
As can be seen, a good case can be made for annuitizing some assets 10
years prior to retirement for retirement at age 50, and 20 years prior
to retirement for retirement at age 70. Despite being the optimal
strategy, the case for annuitization any earlier than this is
weak. The optimal strategy recommends SPIAs be purchased prior to
retirement. Deferred income annuities would be more appropriate,
except that presently in the U.S. the Money's Worth Ratios on deferred
income annuities are significantly worse than those on SPIAs. I would
like to be able to recommend delaying annuitization until retirement,
but for someone retiring at age 70 this means foregoing 5.5% of their
retirement consumption, which is substantial.
</p>

<p>
Repeating the above experiment but with no liability matching bonds
held after the annuitization starting age produced a relative
certainty equivalent consumption of 98.7% for retiring at 50 with
annuitization starting at 40, and 99.3% for retirement at 70 with
annuitization starting at 50. In other words there is essentially no
loss in switching from stocks and liability matching bonds to a simple
stocks and inflation-indexed SPIAs strategy once annuitization begins,
and not worrying about also holding liability matching bonds.
</p>

<p>
Recall that for many individuals Social Security or other defined
benefits will form the most substantial part of their total assets,
and so the recommendation that they fully annuitize their fixed income
assets is readily satisfied.
</p>

<h2>Year of birth</h2>

<p>
All of the figures so far have been for an individual born in 2016.
Were I to repeat the present work, I would choose an earlier date.
The figure below is for an individual born in 1940, currently aged 76,
and expected to be just starting to annuitize stocks. I had expected
some difference, since an individual born today will live longer, but
the extent of the difference surprised me. Whereas someone born today
might annuitize bonds from age 75 to 90, an individual born in 1940
might annuitize them from ages 65 to 90.
</p>

</div>

<p>
An individual born in 1965 would be 51 today, and thus around the age
where they might be expected to annuitize fixed income assets. The
following table shows the certainty equivalent consumption they would
receive if they switched from liability matching bonds to
inflation-indexed SPIAs at the annuitization age, relative to
employing the optimal mixed strategy from birth. As can be seen there
is some degradation in performance relative to being born today, but
not enough to alter the recommended strategy. A good case can still be
made for annuitizing fixed income assets 10 years before retirement if
retiring at 50, and 20 years before if retiring at 70.

<h2>Cost of delay</h2>

<p>
When deciding whether to annuitize what matters is not only the
savings from doing so, but also understanding the magnitude of any
cost of delaying the decision to annuitize.
</p>

<p>
So far I have only considered annuitization of an initial portfolio
that evolves from birth. Here I will do something different. The
reduction in certainty equivalent consumption from delaying the
ability to annuitize by 10 years for a retired individual with a fixed
initial portfolio size starting at a given age is shown in the table
below. Mixed liability matching bonds and income annuities portfolios
were allowed in both cases.

<h2>Nominal SPIAs</h2>

<p>
So far I have only considered inflation indexed SPIAs. Nominal SPIAs
are far more popular. How might they perform?
</p>

<p>
Nominal SPIAs are harder to price, since they are largely backed by
corporate bonds of differing qualities.  I priced them using the yield
curve for nominal constant maturity Treasuries plus 1.4%.  This 1.4%
was appropriate on 2015-12-31, and appears to be correspond to the
BofA Merrill option adjusted spread for A credit rated bonds. Pricing
nominal SPIAs in this way I found an MWR of 95 to 100% for quotes from
ImmediateAnnuities.com.
</p>

<p>
To make the model of nominal SPIAs work it is necessary to come up
with an estimate of inflation, and reduce the real income provided by
the nominal SPIAs by that amount each year. I used 2.3% with a
stochastic volatility of 4.1%. This corresponds to a geometric value
of 2.2% which is the Survey of Professional Forecasters 2015Q4 10 year
forecast, and the historical CPI volatility for 1927-2014. Volatility
today is probably lower.
</p>

<p>
The results for an MWR of 95% are shown below. Nominal SPIAs make a
strong presence and liability matching bonds barely get a look in.
</p>

<div class="center">
<img src="/static/docs/when_to_annuitize/gradual_annuity-ssa-4-0.95-nominal.png" alt="nominal SPIA, MWR=95%">
</div>

<p>
For a $100,000 portfolio at birth the lifetime certainty equivalent
consumption level was $3,260 compared to $3,104 when using
inflation-indexed SPIAs with an MWR against the Treasury real yield
curve of 100%.
</p>

<p>
Nominal SPIAs outperform inflation-indexed SPIAs in a comparison that
intentionally favored inflation-indexed SPIAs, so why aren't they
recommended?  This is because in our model inflation varied randomly
with a volatility of 4.1%. One year it might be 6%, the next -2%, and
the year after that 0%. In reality inflation is sticky, if one year it
is 6%, the next it might be 5%, and the year after that 6%. This could
have a devastating effect on the value of a inflation-indexed
SPIA. Modeling this would be challenging, both in terms of the
computational demands imposed by such a model, and in terms of
attempting to build a model that accurately captures this stickiness.
</p>

<h2>The bottom line</h2>

<p>
To understand why annuitization is valuable I consider retired
individuals with fixed initial portfolio sizes and look at the amount
by which their future certainty equivalent consumption is increased by
their ability to annuitize all or part of the portfolio.
</p>

<p>
Clearly the ability to annuitize matters a great deal, and it matters
more and more the older you get. The ability to balance between
liability matching bonds and inflation indexed SPIAs almost doesn't
matter at all, at least not post retirement.
</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>
We threw a lot of different parameters at the problem and by and large
the results more or less came back the same. This allows us to make
some reasonably general rule of thumb recommendations. These
recommendations apply to the total portfolio, including Social
Security and other defined benefits. Applying them to just the portion
of the total portfolio that is in liquid assets would be a mistake.
</p>

<p>
Stocks. In a balanced stock, liability matching bond,
inflation-indexed SPIA portfolio stock holdings should correspond to
the fraction predicted using Merton's formula based on the value of
&gamma; used:
</p>

<p class="center">
stocks fraction = (&mu; - r) / (&sigma;<sup>2</sup> &gamma;),
</p>

<p>
where &mu; is the expected arithmetic return on stocks, r is the
present liability matching bonds average rate of return, &sigma; is
the volatility of stock returns, and &gamma; is the coefficient of
relative risk aversion.
</p>

<p>
Stock annuitization. I suggest annuitizing stocks on a straight line
basis from age 65 to 90 assuming an MWR of 100%. If you can obtain an
MWR significantly higher than this, as presently seems to be the case
at advanced ages, there is a case for annuitizing earlier as in my
previous work. In reality annuitization won't be performed annually,
but in one or two chunks over the time period.
</p>

<p>
Fixed income. The portion of the total assets that isn't allocated to
stocks forms the fixed income assets: liability matching
inflation-indexed bonds and inflation-indexed income annuities. The
allocatable portion of fixed income assets consists of the total fixed
income assets less the net present value of Social Security and other
defined benefits.
</p>

<p>
Liability matching inflation-indexed bonds. That is inflation-indexed
bonds with a duration matching retirement financial obligations. These
weren't considered in my previous study. In the present economic
environment I found them to dominate regular nominal bonds, and I
would recommend them in place of regular nominal bonds. This is not
always the case, although the difference between using one and the
other does not appear too great. Prior to fixed income anuitization,
holdings of liability matching inflation-indexed bonds should amount
to 100% of fixed income assets.
</p>

<p>
Inflation-indexed income annuities. Ignoring the need for any
emergency funds, post fixed income annuitization, inflation-indexed
income annuities, that is SPIAs and deferred income annuities, should
make up 100% of fixed income assets.
</p>

<p>
Fixed income annuitization. Fixed income annuitization involves the
switch from holding liability matching inflation-indexed bonds to
inflation-indexed income annuities. Annuitization should commence 10
years before retirement for a retirement age of 50, or 20 years before
for a retirement age of 70.  Deferred income annuities make the most
logical sense, although in the U.S. they currently appear
prohibitively expensive. This annuitization isn't necessarily a one
shot event. Depending on stock market performance and cashflows, there
may be a case to annuitize additional assets down the road prior to
the scheduled annuitization of stocks. Delaying fixed income
annuitization until retirement means foregoing either 3.7% or 9.2% in
retirement certainty equivalent consumption for retirement ages of 50
and 70. This might be acceptable to some, but isn't to me.
