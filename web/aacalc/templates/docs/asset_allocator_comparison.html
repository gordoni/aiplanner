<h1>Asset Allocator Comparison</h1>

<p>
I compare the results of 11 popular asset allocators freely available
on the web.
</p>

<p>
The scenario. A 66 year old U.S. male born in 1950. They have just
retired and receive $15,000 a year in Social Security income.  They
have no other income.  Their investment portfolio totals $200,000.
They are unlikely to achieve it, but their desired income level is
$40,000. This is all intended to be relatively realistic of the
situation faced by many retirees. Now the part that is slightly less
realistic. They have constant relative risk aversion of consumption
with a coefficient of relative risk aversion which they know to be
3. They are financially highly sophisticated, and provided it is in
keeping with their moderate risk aversion (sensitivity to change in
consumption), have a high risk tolerance (psychological sensitivity to
investment portfolio loss).
</p>

<p>
I have framed things as above because the problem is then, apart from
adding in the expected asset class returns, fully specified. This
means the problem has a precise mathematical solution. Moreover, the
precise mathematical solution can be computed using a mathematical
technique known as stochastic dynamic programming.
</p>

<p>
Stochastic dynamic programming isn't for the faint of heart. It is
somewhat technical and compute intensive. The answer I computed to
this problem using stochastic dynamic programming is the retiree
should adopt a 100% stocks, 0% fixed income portfolio. This might seem
surprising, but what is happening is the Social Security income
provides a stable cushion, much like bonds, that reduces the effect of
a decline in stocks on consumption levels. My calculations using
stochastic dynamic programming are in keeping with those of
J.P. Morgan Funds in their
paper <a href="https://www.jpmorganfunds.com/blobcontent/13/504/1323375360677_RI-DYNAMIC.pdf">Breaking
the 4% Rule</a>, although they don't show results for portfolio sizes
as "small" as $200,000, and they use a higher coefficient of relative
risk aversion.
</p>

<p>
Recommended asset allocations can vary significantly owing to
uncertainty in the equity premium given the limited historical data
and high volatility. But the above scenario has been chosen so that
the answer computed using stochastic dynamic programming will be 100%
stocks for a broad range of possible equity premiums.
</p>

<p>
The table below shows the recommended asset allocations computed using
different asset allocation calculators.  Wherever possible inputs to
the asset allocation calculators were in keeping with the above
scenario, and answers to other questions kept to their default values.

<p>
So there you have it. Recommended allocations to stocks ranged from 35
to 100%. Caveat emptor.
</p>

<p>
Most calculators are basically risk attitude questionnaires. Attitude
towards investment risk plays an important role in the asset
allocation decision, but it is not the only factor.  As important, or
more important, are consumption requirements, and the resources
available to satisfy that consumption. This is part of investment
companies thinking in terms of investment, and missing the big
picture, which is investments are there to satisfy
consumption. Investment companies should seek to play a role in
informing and shaping attitudes towards investment risk based on
consumption needs and resources, rather than purely seeing risk
tolerance as something that is pre-ordained and needing to be
divined. Only one website (this one) asks about Social Security income
which is the primary source of income for most retirees, and as such
one of the primary determinants of how much risk should be taken with
the investment portfolio.
</p>

<p>
We have seen how the risk tolerance approach alone can underweight
equity requirements. The reverse is also possible. The risk tolerance
approach by itself will put risk tolerant investors with small amounts
of guaranteed income into aggressive investment portfolios when
something less aggressive might be in keeping with their consumption
risk aversion.
</p>

<p>
An ideal solution would be to blend the risk tolerance and
mathematical approaches. To recommend, here is the optimal
mathematical strategy, but here is the strategy you should employ
given your risk tolerance. Such a calculator doesn't presently exist.
</p>

<p>
Footnote: Merton's method is different from stochastic dynamic
programming, although the two approaches are in agreement for the
above scenario.
