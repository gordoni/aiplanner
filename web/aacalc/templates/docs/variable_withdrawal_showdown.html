<h1>Variable Withdrawal Showdown</h1>

<p>
We attempt to realistically compare 6 asset allocation strategies x 7
consumption strategies over the complete asset
accumulation-decumulation life cycle.  Making the comparison realistic
means we consider the importance of Social Security income to
retirement consumption, and we struggle over the appropriate utility
(well being) function associated with different consumption levels. We
might not pin things down perfectly, but we feel the framework we use
is a major improvement over failing to consider Social Security
income, or using a more simple mathematically pure utility function.
</p>

<p>
At some point you are better off purchasing a Single Premium Immediate
Annuity (SPIA), but if you choose not to, the table below indicates
how you would be expected to fare under each of the strategies
relative to age in bonds / 4% rule.

<ul>

<li>Asset allocation:

<ul>

<li>Age in bonds appears a very poor asset allocation strategy for
this realistic scenario. This scenario has a best fixed / SDP asset
allocation of 90/10. This high stock allocation is plausible
remembering that for many retirees Social Security income is their
primary asset and acts as a surrogate bond.</li>

<li>All of the glide path rules perform poorly.</li>

<li>An asset allocation of best fixed with guaranteed income treated
like a bond does very well. Unfortunately there is no easy way to
compute the appropriate best fixed asset allocation (30/70 is the
right answer for best fixed GI-bond / SDP).</li>

</ul>

</li>

<li>Consumption:

<ul>

<li>4% rule and best% rule appear ill-suited to this scenario. The 4%
rule was designed not to deplete the portfolio over a 30 year period,
but in the presence of guaranteed income doing so isn't the end of the
world.</li>

<li>IRS RMD does poorly. This is to be expected. It employs a life
table for a couple with a spouse 10 years younger.</li>

<li>Consumption strategies best constant percentage, VPW, and 1/life
all do well, but fall short of SDP. In VPW's case this is presumably
because of the lack of stochastic mortality, while in 1/life's case it
might be because of the lack of consideration of the portfolio's
potential for growth.</li>

</ul>

</li>

<li>SDP offers the best asset allocation and consumption
strategies. This isn't too surprising. SDP is optimal if returns are
independent over time. The long term time-wise dependence of returns
(reversion to the mean and/or momentum) is relatively weak.</li>

<li>There is a big gap between what may be computed and easily
implemented by an individual using rules of thumb (age minus 10 in
bonds / 1/life) and the best results (SDP / SDP) - a difference of
28%. This is unfortunate and significant. It points to a role for
professional advisors and/or presenting SDP in a more accessible
fashion.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Scenario</h2>

<dl>

<dt>Improvement in Portfolio Consumption (IPC)</dt>

<dd>This is the increase in Certainty Equivalent consumption relative
to age in bonds / 4% rule after factoring out $15,000 in guaranteed
Social Security income. Age in bonds / 4% rule has a CE of $22,442,
SDP / SDP has a CE of $27,667, so the IPC is 70%.</dd>

<dt>Certainty Equivalent (CE) consumption</dt>

<dd>This is the constant consumption over retirement that would have
the same discounted expected utility as the range of simulated
consumption sequences.</dd>

<dt>Stochastic Dynamic Programming (SDP)</dt>

<dd>SDP is a general purpose mathematical technique that can be
applied to asset allocation to compute the optimal asset allocation
and consumption as a function of the current age and current portfolio
size. Correlations between asset classes are allowed.  Asset class
returns are assumed to come from a distribution that is independent
over time. Another name for SDP is backward induction. It computes the
optimal strategy at age 119, uses that information to then compute the
optimal strategy at age 118, and so on.</dd>

<dt>Asset classes</dt>

<dd>Stocks and bonds. Based on historical returns (1927-2013). Stocks
adjusted to 19 country average. Bonds adjusted to U.S. investement
grade bond universe. After expenses:

<ul>
<li>stocks - 5.1% geometric real return; 19.4% std. dev.
<li>bonds - 2.6% geometric real return; 9.7% std. dev.
</ul>

Rebalancing to the target asset allocation is performed annually.  No
attempt is made to constrain asset allocations to a risk
tolerance. Leverage is not allowed.</dd>

<dt>Utility</dt>

<dd>This indicates the desirability of a particular consumption
level. Constant relative risk aversion (CRRA) utility functions have a
number of nice mathematical properties, but they are not especially
realistic. We attempt to remedy this. Below $30,000 we use a CRRA
utility function with a coefficient of relative risk aversion of
4. Highly risk averse.  Above $40,000 we use a CRRA utility function
with a coefficient of relative risk aversion of 1, and with a slope of
1/20th of the first utility segment. Very non-risk averse, and surplus
money is valued very little. In between we interpolate using a cubic
polynomial. In layman's terms, this all means that we will be largely
oblivious to high consumption values, but we will punish a strategy
that results in potentially low consumption very harshly.</dd>

<dt>Discounting</dt>

<dd>The future is valued less than the present for a variety of
reasons. We discount future consumption at a rate of 3% per year.</dd>

<dt>Bequest motive</dt>

<dd>None.</dd>

<dt>Taxes</dt>

<dd>Taxes were not considered.</dd>

<dt>Accumulation</dt>

<dd>Accumulation begins at age 25 of $500/year and grows by 7% real
per year, reaching $6,997 real/year at age 64. A more stochastic
accumulation process might be possible, but it would be difficult to
get the parameters right.</dd>

<dt>Retirement</dt>

<dd>Retirement begins at age 65, and the length of retirement is
random (stochastic). We analyze a male born in 1949 in accordance with
the Social Security Actuaries AS 120 cohort life tables.</dd>

<dt>Guaranteed income</dt>

<dd>We assume an inflation indexed $15,000/year in guaranteed Social
Security income, which will probably provide a majority of the
retiree's income.</dd>

<dt>Platform</dt>

<dd>An internal command line version of
<a href="{% url 'home'%}">AACalc.com</a> was used to generate and
validate the strategies. 50,000 synthetic returns sequences were
produced by bootstrapping the historical record with a block size of
20 years. Each sequence was evaluated for the full range of longevity
possibilities.</dd>

</dl>

<h2>Affluent</h2>

<p>
The scenario above results in a portfolio size of around
$150,000-400,000 at retirement. Doubling the amount of all retirement
contributions increases the expected retirement portfolio to
$250,000-$800,000 and yields the following table:
</p>

<table>
<tr> <td rowspan=2 colspan=2> Improvement in Portfolio
Consumption </td> <td colspan=7> consumption strategy </td> </tr>
<tr> <td> 4% <br /> rule </td> <td> best% <br /> rule </td> <td> best constant <br /> percentage </td> <td> VPW </td> <td> IRS <br /> RMD <td> 1/life </td> <td> SDP </td> </tr>
<tr> <td rowspan=6> asset allocation strategy </td> <td> age in bonds </td> <td> - </td> <td> 5% </td> <td> 13% </td> <td> 17% </td> <td> 2% </td> <td> 14% </td> <td> 22% </td> </tr>
<tr> <td> age minus 10 in bonds </td> <td> 4% </td> <td> 9% </td> <td> 18% </td> <td> 22% </td> <td> 6% </td> <td> 18% </td> <td> 27% </td> </tr>
<tr> <td> target date </td> <td> 5% </td> <td> 10% </td> <td> 20% </td> <td> 23% </td> <td> 8% </td> <td> 19% </td> <td> 28% </td> </tr>
<tr> <td> best fixed </td> <td> 5% </td> <td> 11% </td> <td> 26% </td> <td> 27% </td> <td> 12% </td> <td> 24% </td> <td> 34% </td> </tr>
<tr> <td> best fixed GI-bond </td> <td> 11% </td> <td> 16% </td> <td> 30% </td> <td> 30% </td> <td> 16% </td> <td> 28% </td> <td> 38% </td> </tr>
<tr> <td> SDP </td> <td> n/a </td> <td> n/a </td> <td> 29% </td> <td> 29% </td> <td> 16% </td> <td> 25% </td> <td> 36% </td> </tr>
</table>

<p>
The absolute magnitude of the improvements are reduced, but the
conclusions are largely unchanged.
</p>

<h2>Constrained</h2>

<p>
Reducing all retirement contributions by a factor of 2.5 yields the
following table:
<p>

<table>
<tr> <td rowspan=2 colspan=2> Improvement in Portfolio
Consumption </td> <td colspan=7> consumption strategy </td> </tr>
<tr> <td> 4% <br /> rule </td> <td> best% <br /> rule </td> <td> best constant <br /> percentage </td> <td> VPW </td> <td> IRS <br /> RMD <td> 1/life </td> <td> SDP </td> </tr>
<tr> <td rowspan=6> asset allocation strategy </td> <td> age in bonds </td> <td> - </td> <td> 38% </td> <td> 45% </td> <td> 45% </td> <td> 18% </td> <td> 46% </td> <td> 48% </td> </tr>
<tr> <td> age minus 10 in bonds </td> <td> 5% </td> <td> 46% </td> <td> 54% </td> <td> 54% </td> <td> 26% </td> <td> 56% </td> <td> 58% </td> </tr>
<tr> <td> target date </td> <td> 9% </td> <td> 50% </td> <td> 59% </td> <td> 59% </td> <td> 30% </td> <td> 61% </td> <td> 63% </td> </tr>
<tr> <td> best fixed </td> <td> 18% </td> <td> 58% </td> <td> 82% </td> <td> 82% </td> <td> 50% </td> <td> 84% </td> <td> 87% </td> </tr>
<tr> <td> best fixed GI-bond </td> <td> 21% </td> <td> 68% </td> <td> 86% </td> <td> 86% </td> <td> 53% </td> <td> 88% </td> <td> 91% </td> </tr>
<tr> <td> SDP </td> <td> n/a </td> <td> n/a </td> <td> 86% </td> <td> 86% </td> <td> 53% </td> <td> 88% </td> <td> 91% </td> </tr>
</table>

<p>
Once again the conclusions are largely unchanged.
