<br />

This calculator does not include a questionnaire on risk tolerance
(your psychological ability to stomach investment losses). Instead it
primarily concerned with computing the appropriate strategy given your risk
aversion (preference for uniform consumption).

<br />
<br />

Several things set this calculator apart:

<ul>

<li> A balance sheet approach - asset allocation can't be performed in
isolation, but must be performed by taking into account the presence
and size of Social Security, Pensions, 401(k)'s, income annuities, and
home equity. See the <a href="{% url 'docs' 'faq' %}">FAQ</a> for more
details.</li>

{% if mode == 'aa' %}
<li> Future contributions - the impact of any possible future
contributions is handled by entering their expected annual amount,
growth rate, and volatility. </li>
{%endif %}

<li> A true risk free asset - liability matching bonds, that is
inflation indexed zero coupon bonds with a duration matching that of
anticipated retirement cash flows, not cash, are used as the true risk
free asset. Liability matching bonds might be hard to purchase, but a
TIPS ladder, or a TIPS bond fund of appropriate duration, is a close
substitute. </li>

<li> Income annuities - income annuities are a valuable tool in the
retirement toolbox. This calculator optionally recommends the
purchase of inflation indexed income annuities, be they single premium
immediate annuities or deferred income annuities. </li>

<li> Home equity - home equity is the largest asset class for many
individuals.  It is thus important to consider the appropriate role of
home equity in the retirement planning process. </li>

<li> Admit what we don't know - returns from the stock market are
intrinsically unknown. We generate a range of results for different
plausible scenarios. </li>

<li> Cross validated - sample Merton's method recommendations produced
by this calculator have been
<a href="{% url 'docs' 'validation' %}">cross validated</a> with a
second asset allocator that uses stochastic dynamic programming. </li>

<li> Open source - available under a GNU Affero license on

will go towards retirement savings. Contribution amount should consist
only of new money contributed to your retirement savings, not the
payout from any existing pre-retirement defined benefits. Reduction
when only one spouse is working will normally equal the after tax
income of the retired spouse, should be expressed prior to applying
any growth rate, and can exceed the contribution amount if drawdown is
then occuring. A growth
rate of 5% represents a doubling every 14 years.
Remember to take into account life events such as promotions, or

Losing the game means having an unbearably low level of consumption.
Safe assets (liability matching bonds or possibly income annuities) are allocated to try and ensure consumption never falls
below this level. If the user does not have enough safe assets to
insure the needed consumption level, the program will first reduce
regular bond holdings and substitute safe assets, and then if that
proves insufficient stock holdings will be reduced. Retirement
consumption should be expressed in
current inflation-indexed dollars. Normally you don't need to specify
a value here as the right thing to do will be determined based on your
risk aversion which is specified later. Specifying a value here will
potentially override the impact of the risk aversion coefficient and
directly dictate the asset allocation.

Use liability matching bonds <a title="It is useful to note the differences between regular bonds and liability matching bonds. Liability matching bonds reflect the current real yield curve, so there is no option to change the return assumption for such bonds. Liability matching bonds are typically long duration because they are intended to match long-term liabilities (future retirement withdrawals), and therefore such bonds may exhibit significant short-term volatility, making them unattractive to investors with a low risk tolerance. Note that this is an issue dealing with risk tolerance and not risk aversion -- two concepts explained later.

Regular bonds allow input flexibility for both return and volatility. For example, for a user with low risk tolerance, it may make sense to utilize short-term regular bonds as an asset class to keep volatility down. This can be accomplished by adjusting the default return and volatility parameters downward to reflect expectations for shorter-term bonds."><img src="/static/images/Information-icon.png" alt="[?]"></a>: {{ alloc_form.use_lm_bonds }}
{{ alloc_form.use_lm_bonds.errors }}
<div class="small">
Inflation-indexed liability matching bonds are a valuable retirement
planning tool. However the short term volatility of long duration
liability matching bonds may make them unattractive to investors with
a low risk tolerance. If liability matching bonds are not used we
naively replace them with regular bonds.
</div>
<br />
Permit recommendation of income annuities <a title="Unlike investing in stocks and bonds, the purchase of income annuities requires an irreversible commitment. Therefore the program does not recommend annuity purchase unless there is both a clear advantage of increased consumption and a clear advantage for purchasing “now” versus waiting a year. 

Annuitization is evaluated as a second separate pass over the input data, and is only recommended if the expected consumption amount is at least 4% higher than without annuitizing, and the estimated lifetime cost of delaying the decision by one year is more than 0.1% of the potential income annuity purchase amount.

These are the rules for what annuitization looks like: Stocks get annuitized linearly from age 65 to 90, regular bonds get annuitized linearly from 30 to 60, and liability matching bonds get 100% annuitized if the user is older than a specific age between 40 and 50 (depending on retirement age between 50 and 70), otherwise they get 0%. The choice of ages reflects rough judgement about returns from stocks and bonds versus annuity returns including mortality credits."><img src="/static/images/Information-icon.png" alt="[?]"></a>: {{ alloc_form.purchase_income_annuity }}

how psychologically comfortable you are with losses to your investment

Risk tolerance: 10% annual chance of experiencing real investment
portfolio losses of {{ alloc_form.risk_tolerance_pct }}% or more.
{{ alloc_form.risk_tolerance_pct.errors }}
<div class="small">
Risk tolerance is concerned with the ability to psychologically handle
losses to your investment portfolio, and not pull out of the market in
the event of a downturn.  Risk tolerance differs from risk aversion by
only looking at investment assets rather than the total portfolio
including defined benefits. Setting it to a low or intermediate value
provides for peace of mind but will reduce your expected
consumption. In an ideal world it might be set as high as possible so
that risk aversion, which looks at the total portfolio, can take over
in determining the appropriate asset allocation. For the default
market parameters a value of 18% or higher effectively imposes no
constraints. Setting it to a value of 10% or less is only possible for
ages above about 40, or if you also alter the default market
parameters to be indicative of shorter-term bonds.

We recommend adopting a
<!-- healthcheck_aa --> {{ results.calc.0.aa_equity_pct }}/{{ results.calc.0.aa_bonds_pct }}
stock/bond asset allocation.
<div class="small">
Asset allocation is between stocks and regular bonds plus liability
matching bonds. For many scenarios a stock heavy asset allocation is
appropriate because defined benefits are in many ways similar to
bonds.
Stock holdings should be diversified. At least 20 different
stocks. Preferably many more. Such diversification can be obtained
using a low cost index fund.
Regular bond holdings are nominal and should also be diversified.
Again an index fund suffices.
Liability matching bonds should be inflation indexed and have a
duration of about {{ results.calc.0.lm_bonds_duration }} years.

With about {{ alloc_form.cleaned_data.confidence_pct }}% confidence
the proportion of stocks recommended is in the range
{{ results.calc.1.aa_equity_pct }}% to {{ results.calc.2.aa_equity_pct }}%.
<div class="small">
This range can be very large as a result of intrinsic uncertainty in
the expected premium of equities over bonds given only about 100 years
of historical data and a high volatility. For more details see
<a href="http://ssrn.com/abstract=2675390">Asset Allocation Confidence
Intervals in Retirement</a>.
For confidence intervals in excess of about 95% the computed
lower bound will be lower than it should be. This is because demand
side effects mean we can be confident the return for equities exceeds
that of bonds.
</div>

<br />

{% if mode == 'aa' %}

The amount you should consume during retirement varies from year to
year. Currently it is recommended
you should consume around <!-- healthcheck_consume --> {{ results.calc.0.consume }}
after tax and after mortgage payments per year when fully retired.
An {{ alloc_form.cleaned_data.confidence_pct }}% confidence interval
on this recommendation is {{ results.calc.1.consume }} to
{{ results.calc.2.consume }}.
